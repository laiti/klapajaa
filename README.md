# klapajaa
Control your Music Player Daemon with clapping your hands.

This is rather simple integration with komponist and clap-detector node modules. Detect the clap and send command to your MPD instance.

Configure the clap.json and mpd.json and off you go. In case you need help with the first one, see https://www.npmjs.com/package/clap-detector#configuration.
