# klapajaa
Control your Music Player Daemon with clapping your hands.

This is rather simple integration with clap-detector and komponist node modules. First one detects the clap and later one sends command to your MPD instance.

### Installation
* npm install
* Configure the clap.json and mpd.json and off you go. In case you need help with the first one, see https://www.npmjs.com/package/clap-detector#configuration.

### Running
* nodejs index.js
